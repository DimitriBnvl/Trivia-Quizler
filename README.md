# Trivia-Quizler
For Day 17 and later refined on Day 34 of '100 Days of Code', I made a simple trivia quiz that can be altered to ask about various topics, from computer science to animals and classic general knowledge.

## What I Learned
This project dove deeper into Object-oriented programming, in which I strongly enjoyed the structure and organization that comes with it. Separating the program into modules makes it significantly easier for me to know what I am working on exactly, even weeks after having created the project. This realization truly showed me the power of OOP, a paradigm necessary for building greater undertakings.
